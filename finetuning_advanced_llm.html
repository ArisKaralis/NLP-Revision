        <h1>Section 2.6: Fine-tuning and Advanced LLM Techniques</h1>
        <p>
            Pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT and Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 2
            derive much of their utility from their adaptability to various downstream tasks through
            fine-tuning or by leveraging advanced interaction techniques.
        </p>

        <section id="bert-finetuning">
            <h2>BERT Fine-tuning (General Process)</h2>
            <p>The standard procedure for adapting a pre-trained BERT model to a specific supervised task involves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Model Initialization:</strong> Weights of BERT are initialized with parameters from pre-training.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Task-Specific Output Layer:</strong> A new, typically small, output layer is added. Its structure depends on the task:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sequence classification (sentiment, NLI): Linear classifier on top of <code>[CLS]</code> token's final hidden state.</li>
                        <li>Token classification (NER, SQuAD QA): Linear classifier on top of each token's final hidden state.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Input Formatting:</strong> Downstream task data is formatted to match BERT's pre-training input (<code>[CLS]</code>, <code>[SEP]</code>, segment embeddings).</li>
                <li><strong>End-to-End Fine-tuning:</strong> All parameters (BERT + new layer) are jointly fine-tuned on labeled task-specific data. This adapts learned representations. Fine-tuning is much less computationally expensive than pre-training.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Scalability (BERT Fine-tuning):</strong> Significantly less resource-intensive than pre-training. Requires labeled data for the specific task, but often much less than needed to train a model from scratch. The main cost is GPU time for training epochs, which depends on dataset size and model variant (Base vs. Large).</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="llama2-chat-finetuning">
            <h2>Llama 2-Chat Fine-tuning</h2>
            <p>
                Llama 2-Chat models are specifically fine-tuned from pre-trained Llama 2 models to excel in
                dialogue applications, with a strong emphasis on helpfulness and safety. This is a multi-stage process.
            </p>
            <h4>1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Initial alignment of base Llama 2 towards following instructions and dialogue.</li>
                <li><strong>Data:</strong> High-quality instruction-following data (prompt-answer pairs). Llama 2 paper emphasizes quality over quantity over quantity (~27,540 curated examples).</li>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> Model fine-tuned using an autoregressive objective; loss typically computed only on answer tokens.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality vs. Quantity:</strong> The Llama 2 paper (Touvron et al., 2023) found that using fewer but higher-quality examples improved results significantly. The authors observed that SFT model outputs were often competitive with human-written data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)</h4>
            <p>Further refines model behavior based on human preferences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Human Preference Data Collection:</strong> Annotators choose preferred response between two model-generated outputs for a prompt, often rating preference degree. Focus on helpfulness and safety. According to the Llama 2 paper, over 1 million binary comparisons were collected, with annotators using specific guidelines and indicating degree of preference (from "significantly better" to "negligibly better/unsure").
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reward Modeling (RM):</strong> One or more RMs trained on preference data. RM takes prompt + response, outputs a scalar score for alignment with human preferences. Llama 2-Chat trains separate RMs for helpfulness and safety. RM architecture is similar to base LLM with a regression head. Binary ranking loss is common. The paper notes that accuracy is higher for pairs with stronger preference.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Iterative Model Refinement (Policy Optimization):</strong> SFT model (policy) further fine-tuned using RL algorithms, with RM providing reward.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):</strong> Maximizes expected RM reward with a penalty (e.g., KL divergence) to prevent drastic deviation from SFT model, aiding stability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rejection Sampling Fine-tuning:</strong> Alternative/complementary. Sample K outputs from policy for a prompt. RM scores them; highest-scoring output selected. Model fine-tuned (SFT-like) on these "best-of-K" samples. Llama 2-Chat used this mainly with its largest model.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Ghost Attention (GAtt)</h4>
            <p>Technique for Llama 2-Chat to improve multi-turn dialogue consistency, especially remembering initial instructions (e.g., "act as a pirate").</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Method:</strong> During fine-tuning (often SFT-like stage after RLHF), initial instruction synthetically concatenated to all user messages in training dialogues. Loss set to 0 for tokens from previous turns to avoid issues where intermediate assistant messages wouldn't have had access to this repeated instruction. This "hacks" data to remind model of overarching instruction.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> According to the Llama 2 paper, GAtt was inspired by Context Distillation and helps attention focus in multi-turn dialogues by maintaining the initial context throughout the conversation.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Scalability (Llama 2-Chat Fine-tuning):</strong> SFT is less costly than pre-training but still requires significant data and compute. RLHF is complex and iterative, involving human annotation (expensive and time-consuming), reward model training, and RL fine-tuning. Each step requires careful management and considerable resources. GAtt adds a data preprocessing step but doesn't fundamentally change the fine-tuning compute requirements otherwise.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="advanced-prompting">
            <h2>Advanced Prompting and Reasoning Techniques</h2>
            <p>These techniques focus on how to interact with pre-trained LLMs to elicit more complex behaviors, often without further fine-tuning.</p>
            <h4>1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting</h4>
            <p>
                Encourages LLM to generate a step-by-step reasoning process leading to an answer, instead of just the final answer. Often achieved by few-shot prompting with examples showing intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., for math word problems). Significantly improves performance on tasks requiring multi-step arithmetic, commonsense, or symbolic reasoning.
            </p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <h5>Simplified Example: CoT Prompting</h5>
                <p><strong>Standard Prompt:</strong> "Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? A:"</p>
                <p><strong>CoT Prompt:</strong> "Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? A: Roger started with 5 balls. He bought 2 cans of 3 balls each, which is 2 * 3 = 6 balls. So he has 5 + 6 = 11 balls. The final answer is 11."</p>
            </div>

            <h4>2. Self-Consistency</h4>
            <p>
                Builds on CoT. Samples multiple diverse reasoning paths from LLM (e.g., using non-zero temperature). Final answer selected by majority vote over answers from these paths. Improves robustness and accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                As described in Wang et al. (2022), "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models," this method:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sampling:</strong> Generates multiple diverse reasoning paths using temperature sampling or top-k truncation from the same prompt</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> Takes the most consistent answer across paths via majority voting</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Shows significant improvements across arithmetic reasoning tasks (AddSub, MultiArith, GSM8K) and commonsense reasoning tasks</li>
                <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> Performance generally improves with more reasoning paths (e.g., sampling 40 paths), though with increased computational cost</li>
                <li><strong>Additional benefits:</strong> Provides uncertainty estimates and improves calibration</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. SELF-REFINE</h4>
            <p>Iterative framework where an LLM improves its own generated output without additional training data or external feedback.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Generate:</strong> LLM produces initial output.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Same LLM prompted to provide feedback on its own output (errors, improvements).</li>
                <li><strong>Refine:</strong> LLM uses original input, initial output, and its own feedback to generate refined output. Cycle can be repeated.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                According to Madaan et al. (2023), "SELF-REFINE: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback," this approach:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Uses few-shot prompts for generation, feedback, and refinement with existing LLMs (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, GPT-4)</li>
                <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Evaluated on diverse tasks including dialogue response generation, code optimization, code readability improvement, math reasoning, sentiment reversal, acronym generation, and constrained generation</li>
                <li><strong>Results:</strong> Shows consistent improvement across tasks and models, with the FEEDBACK step being crucial—generic feedback or no feedback leads to reduced scores</li>
                <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Multiple iterations improve output quality, though with diminishing returns</li>
                <li><strong>Human Evaluation:</strong> SELF-REFINE outputs were preferred over simply generating multiple initial outputs (1 vs k comparison)</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Reduces the cost of human creative processes and avoids training a separate refiner, making it simple and widely applicable</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="knowledge-augmentation">
            <h2>Knowledge Augmentation</h2>
            <p>Addresses limitation that LLM knowledge is static (frozen at pre-training) and may be incomplete/outdated.</p>
            <h4>1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h4>
            <p>Enhances LLMs by allowing access to and incorporation of info from external knowledge source (non-parametric memory) during generation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Retriever:</strong> Given query/prompt, searches large corpus (e.g., Wikipedia) and retrieves relevant passages (e.g., using dense passage retriever like DPR).</li>
                        <li><strong>Generator:</strong> Pre-trained Seq2Seq LLM (e.g., BART, Llama) takes original query + retrieved passages as combined input to generate final output.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>RAG-Sequence vs. RAG-Token:</strong> RAG-Sequence uses same retrieved docs for entire output. RAG-Token can retrieve different docs for generating each output token.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduces hallucinations by grounding in factual external docs, allows access to up-to-date/domain-specific info, improves factual accuracy and relevance.</li>
            </ul>
             <div class="example-box">
                <h5>Simplified Example: RAG</h5>
                <p><strong>Query:</strong> "What were the main findings of the Llama 2 paper?"</p>
                <p><strong>Retriever:</strong> Fetches relevant sections from the Llama 2 paper (external document).</p>
                <p><strong>Generator:</strong> Uses the query and fetched sections to synthesize an answer summarizing the findings.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>2. Generate-then-Read (GENREAD)</h4>
            <p>Alternative to explicit retrieval. LLM first prompted to generate relevant contextual documents or background info based on input query.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong>

                <p><strong>Scalability (Prompting & Augmentation):</strong> CoT, Self-Consistency, and SELF-REFINE increase inference cost as they involve generating more text or iterative steps. As noted in the Self-Consistency paper (Wang et al., 2022), sampling multiple reasoning paths significantly increases computation but provides substantial gains in accuracy. SELF-REFINE similarly trades increased generation cost for improved output quality through its multi-step process. RAG adds the cost of retrieval (indexing a large corpus and performing search) and processing longer inputs for the generator. GENREAD also increases generation cost. These methods trade off increased computational cost at inference for improved performance, reasoning, or factuality without retraining the base LLM.</p>

                The fine-tuning process, especially complex multi-stage approaches like RLHF for Llama 2-Chat, highlights that transforming a general-purpose pre-trained LLM into a specialized, aligned, and safe conversational agent is a significant undertaking.

                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Introduce Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned chat models (7B to 70B parameters), with focus on helpfulness and safety.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Model Scale:</strong> Available in three sizes: 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters. A 34B variant was also trained but not initially released due to insufficient safety testing time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Architectural Improvements:</strong> Based on the original LLaMA architecture with key enhancements:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased context length from 2k to 4k tokens (4096)</li>
                            <li>Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for larger models (34B and 70B) to improve inference efficiency</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> 2 trillion tokens from publicly available sources (40% increase from LLaMA 1), with emphasis on up-sampling factual sources to increase knowledge and reduce hallucinations. No data from Meta's products or services was used.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Filtering:</strong> Removed data from sites known to contain high volumes of personal information. Less aggressive filtering than some other models to maintain broader usability and avoid demographic erasure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT):</strong> Emphasized quality over quantity, with 27,540 carefully curated annotation examples. Higher-quality but fewer examples improved results significantly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Preference Data:</strong> Collected over 1 million binary comparisons for RLHF, focusing separately on helpfulness and safety. Annotators labeled degree of preference (from "significantly better" to "negligibly better/unsure").</li>
                    <li><strong>Reward Modeling:</strong> Separate reward models for helpfulness and safety performed best due to tension between objectives. Reward model accuracy scaled with both model size and data volume.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ghost Attention (GAtt):</strong> Novel technique to help models maintain focus in multi-turn dialogues by synthetically concatenating the initial instruction to all user messages during fine-tuning, masking loss for tokens from previous turns. Evaluation showed GAtt maintained consistency for 20+ turns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Context Distillation:</strong> Technique to enhance safety efficiently, especially for adversarial prompts. Involves prefixing models with safety preprompts during generation, then fine-tuning on their own safe outputs without the preprompt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety Focus:</strong> Comprehensive alignment process including SFT, RLHF, extensive red teaming, and context distillation. Evaluation showed significantly lower toxicity compared to other open models and competitive performance with some closed models.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Llama 2 models generally outperform Llama 1 and other open-source models like MPT and Falcon on most benchmarks. Llama 2 70B is competitive with some closed models like PaLM (540B) but still trails GPT-4 and PaLM-2-L.</li>

                    <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Uses few-shot prompts for generation, feedback, and refinement with existing LLMs (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, GPT-4).</li>
                    <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Evaluated on 7 diverse tasks including dialogue, code optimization, math reasoning, sentiment reversal, acronym generation, and constrained generation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Results:</strong> Consistently improves performance across tasks and models. The FEEDBACK step is crucial—generic feedback or no feedback leads to reduced scores.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Multiple iterations improve output quality, though with diminishing returns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Evaluation:</strong> SELF-REFINE outputs were preferred over simply generating multiple initial outputs (1 vs k comparison).</li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Reduces the cost of human creative processes and avoids training a separate refiner, making it simple and widely applicable.</li>

            <h3 id="research-connections">Connections Between Research Areas</h3>
            <p>
                These papers collectively illustrate the multi-faceted landscape of LLM development:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Evolution of Foundation Models:</strong> LLaMA and Llama 2 show the progression from base pretraining to extensive chat-specific fine-tuning, highlighting the importance of data quality and alignment techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Architectural Innovations:</strong> RoFormer and RMSNorm contribute improvements to core transformer components (position encoding and layer normalization), enhancing efficiency and performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Training Enhancement:</strong> Self-Consistency and SELF-REFINE demonstrate how existing powerful models can be further improved through advanced prompting and iterative refinement without additional training.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> A conceptual link exists between Llama 2's RLHF process (learning from human preference feedback) and SELF-REFINE's self-feedback mechanism—both involve feedback loops to improve output quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety and Responsibility:</strong> Llama 2's comprehensive safety alignment process exemplifies the growing importance of responsible AI deployment, with extensive red teaming and evaluation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The field continues to advance through these complementary approaches: improving base architectures, scaling with high-quality data, aligning with human values through fine-tuning, and developing innovative prompting and enhancement techniques.
